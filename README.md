## Requirements

The database can be opened with any [SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) compatible software.
The included scripts require Python 3.6 or newer, with the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Figures

- Figure 1 is generated by `f1-all.py`
- Figure 2 is generated by `f2-subgroups.py`
- Figure 3 is generated by `f3-correlation.py`

## Tables

- Supplementary table 1 is generated by `t1-all-midpoints.py`

## Numbers

Numbers that appear in the text can be obtained using the scripts listed below.

- `d1-counts.py`
  - Number of studies surveyed.
  - Number of reports (1 or more per publication) of `Va` and/or `Vi`.
  - Number of reports of `Va` AND `Vi`.
- `d2-sigmas.py`
  - Min/max and mean of standard deviation in `Va` in `Vi`.
- `d3-means.py`
  - Min/max and mean of `Va` and `Vi`.
- `d4-temperatures`
  - Minimum and maximum temperatures.
- `d5-between-exp`
  - Range of between-experiment variability in studies with more than 1
    experiment.
- `f3-correlation.py`
  - Best fit slope and offset.
  - Pearson correlation coefficient.
